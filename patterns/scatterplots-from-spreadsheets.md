Walkthrough: Scatterplot
========================

**This tutorial uses Google spreadsheets to create a scatterplot. There is sample data for this tutorial
[here](http://dump.tentacleriot.eu/wb-gdp-health-life.csv) .**

So let’s create a scatterplot.

1. Start with World Bank Data.
2. Copy it to a new sheet and put the columns “healthcare expenditure total per person” and “life expectancy” next to each other.

3. Click `insert` `charts...` and select “scatter plot” from charts.
4. Select the first one, since this is what we want to do.
5. And there you go: simply adapt the scatterplot so it looks nice.
Don’t forget to label axes. Try to make the dots smaller if there is significant overlap.
